I use Karabiner-Elements to make my Caps Lock key act as `control+option+command`. This gives me a clean keyboard layer in AeroSpace​ to set up shortcuts, so I never interfere with any native macOS ones.

- **AeroSpace** (a tiling window manager)
- **Karabiner-Elements** (a heavy-duty keyboard customizer)
